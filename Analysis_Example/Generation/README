In this example, we create two independent samples, 10000 events for each.
- For a generic sample of tau pairs use TauGen.py
- For a generic sample of bbbar (mixed) use EvtGen.py

Note: in both cases the output files are saved in "OutputFiles" folder,
      please create it before to run the scripts.
