Previous to our analysis we will create and test all scripts with two toy samples.

The two samples correspond to tau pairs and bbbars (mixed), both of them decaying generically.
These files are in mdst format, so we need to create a table to train mva models.
However, to have the option to export the data in a csv format we have an intermediate step, where 
we will create ntuples from a list of objects (particles) and then create a vector (table) in plain format.

The ntuples files will be created according to the event to study (for this test we choose tau -> pi pi pi nu) 
with the scrips in the "Preselection" folder.

In "MVA" folder there will be several options from basic to advance, but now it is in progress.
