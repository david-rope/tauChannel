This folder contains the configuration file for 
  
  tau+ tau-
    |   |
    |   -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau
    -> tau+ -> generic

based in Fortran and that will be used to generated our sample.

You can generated
 * Only the MC sample to know the kinematics of the particles (../Generation/generation_TAUOLA.py).
 * Include the detector simulation and the propagation of the particles through them (../Generation/generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py).
 * And also you can add the beam background files (now they are only available in KEKCC) (../Generation/generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py).
 
 If you want to generate a different tau decay please add the configuration file here.
