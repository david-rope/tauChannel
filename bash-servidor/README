In this folder we can found the bash scripts to generate a sample in acaxees where basf2 through cvmfs was previously installed. 
In this sense, you will probably need to change the release version used in these scripts, here the release-05-01-05 was used.

Then, gen_mc.sh create a number of jobs with the script scripts/generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py, so you can change the
script to generate a different sample. However, the number of event per jobs is set to 1000 because the jobs need to finish in 
one hour otherwise they will kiil automatically. 

How to run,
bash gen_mc.sh [init job] [number of jobs]

where [init job] is just an indice that will be used to set the name of the generated files, the total number of jobs will be
setting by [number of jobs]. To save the samples a folder called 'batch' will be created with four kind of files, the 'script.sh'
to run the job, 'script.sh.e...' to save the errors at running the job, 'script.sh.o...' to save the output while runnnig
'generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py' and its output which will be 'sample.root'.

After all jobs finish, it is important to create a new folder 'batch/RootFiles' and move the files 'samples.root' to there because
ntuples.sh will be run in over these files, otherwise, you will need to choose them in other way.

To used, ntuples.sh you need to choose the script inside the folder 'scripts' (just reconstruct_tau_3pipi0.py for the moment).
How to run,
bash ntuples.sh
where their output is similar to gen_mc.sh, but a folder 'batchN' will be created.
