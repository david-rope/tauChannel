# Tau Channel

Here, we present the study of the tau- -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau channel in Belle II using different multivariate algorithms (included in TMVA for ROOT).

But before starting the algorithms training we need to generate our samples. This is done, first with the configuration for tau- -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau channel that will be used for the KKMC simulator.  This configuration files (other channels can be included) is in the folder Data.

The number of events to generate, the database conditions for the detector and trigger conditions are set in the Generation folder's scripts.

Then,
