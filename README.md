# Tau Channel

Here, we present the study of the tau- -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau channel in Belle II using different multivariate algorithms (included in TMVA for ROOT).

But before to start to training them we need to generat our samples. This is done, first with the configuration for tau- -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau channel and that will KKMC simulator.  This configuration files (other channels can be included) are in the folder Data.
