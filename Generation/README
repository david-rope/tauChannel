This folder contains the generation scripts with three options.

You can generate
 * Only the MC sample to know the kinematics of the particles (generation_TAUOLA.py).
 * Include the detector simulation and the propagation of the particles through them (generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py).
 * And also you can add the beam background files (now they are only available in KEKCC) (generation_GEN_SIM_REC_wo_Bkg.py).
 
 The output files will save in RootFiles folder with root extension.
 
 The main features include 
  * The database condition (in case of official MC samples)
  * Number of events
  * The corresponding trigger configuration (now Phase 3)
