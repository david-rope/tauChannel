Now there are no relevant scripts for the channel 

  tau+ tau-
    |   |
    |   -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau
    -> tau+ -> generic

We just filled the particle list for charged particles: e-, mu-, k and p.
Also the particle list for photons and pi0.

These particles lists are filled with reconstructed tracks and the corresponding mass hyphotesis.
Which means that each track can be defined as e-, mu-, k or p.


Also, a NTuple folder should be created before run these scripts or change the save location.
The input files can be changed but now they are in ..Generation/RootFiles

But the output files will be use to train the algorithms in TMVA.
