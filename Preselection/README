Now there are no relevant scripts for the channel 

  tau+ tau-
    |   |
    |   -> pi+ mu- mu- nu_tau
    -> tau+ -> generic

We just filled the particle list for charged particles: e-, mu-, k and p.
Also the particle list for photons and pi0.

These particles lists are filled with reconstructed tracks and the corresponding mass hyphotesis.
Which means that each track can be defined as e-, mu-, k or p (with the corresponding PID) and each 
particle have their characteristics: momentum (3D vector), deposited energy, hit in each detector, etc.
Furthermore, we have events variables like thrust, total deposited energy, spherical variables, etc.

All these variables need to be optimized to obtain the biggest sample of our signal. Here, we need to
consider the other background (bbbar, ccbar, ddbar, ...).

The main idea of this step is to have only a tau+ tau- sample. Then it will apply  mva algorithms to discriminate
our tau channel.

To do: find out the size of the output files (grid requirements). Of course, write the preselection script.
